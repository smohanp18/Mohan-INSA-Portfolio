## Course Overview & Learning

### Descriptive Part :
In this course 'Internet of Things with oneM2M standard' I had the opportunity to explore OM2M standard for IoT middleware architecture by practicing the OM2M software originally developed at LAAS-CNRS by teams of researchers from the University of Toulouse (INSA, UPS).

While practicing the OM2M software, I tried to explore more in the directions as indicated in the questions seen below.

1. What is ‘Internet of things’? What are the technologies that make an IoT end-to-end architecture? 
2. What are the applications domain in IoT? What are the main standards in IoT? 
3. What are key principles of OneM2M standard? How OneM2M interworks with other standards and technologies? 
4. How to deploy an IoT architecture with OM2M? 
5. What are the types of nodes used, the entities interacting with the middleware, the level at which the objects / sensors interact with the system?
6. What are the different applications interacting with OM2M?
7. Using OM2M how to interact with connected objects and view the data sent by them?
8. How one can manipulate different oneM2M resources (CSE-BASE, AE, CNT, CIN, SUB, REMOTE CSE) and how to interact with them?


### Technical Part :
From the OM2M architecture perspective, I would like to highlight at which layer I was focussing and what I learnt. 

OneM2M is an IoT/M2M standardization agency that has developed a common M2M Service Layer which can be readily embedded within various hardware and software, and relied upon to connect the myriad of devices in the field with IoT/M2M application servers worldwide. OneM2M’s common service layer (CSE) enables to develop IoT/M2M services independent of the underlying network, thereby, facilitates the deployment of vertical applications and heterogeneous devices.

The Sensors/actuators ‘AE’ devices in the AE layer can be from any vendor and can be made for any vertical application domain. The communication network protocols in the Network layer can be any technology. Still, the OneM2M’s CSE layer helps to connect the Sensors/actuators to the IoT/M2M application servers; And, thus the data retreived from sensors/actuators of any vertical application can be transported to the cloud.

### Skills analysis : 

I followed the following approach/steps using the coursework from ‘activity’ and ‘TP’ materials to deploy the OM2M architecture. Please find the skills that I have gained in the ‘Outcome’ column.
