### Module C : Communication Protocols TP - Pr.Laurent CHASSERAT / Pr.Loubet

#### Descriptive Part :
**A. Group work on Physical and MAC layer of NB-IoT tech**<br>
Being part of the 3-member group, the work I did was on NB-IoT technology especially with focus on Physical and MAC layer technical specifications and real-world deployment cases. 

**B. Individual work on MAC Layer for IoT Networks**<br>
In this individual work, I explored the MAC layer functions in the IoT LPWA networks. Especially, I chose one ‘licensed’ and one ‘proprietary’ technology, compare them with respect to MAC layer functions such as ‘cell access’, mobility of connected devices. 

**C. Group exercise based on BLE tech**<br>
In this group exercise, we learnt to solve questions on physical layer aspects of Bluetooth Low Energy – frequency band, modulation methods, packet structure, throughput, effect of interferences, transmitted power, sensitivity, radio range in free space and indoor.

**D. Individual work on GNURadio**<br>
In this work, I explored the applied mathematics concepts behind the modulation and demodulation of wireless transmission technologies. 

#### Technical Part :

**A. Group work on Physical and MAC layer of NB-IoT tech**

I collected the Physical and MAC layer specifications details of NB-IoT technology such as bandwidth, data rate, mobility, Modulation etc. Then, I compared the specifications with the other cellular technologies such as LTE-M. And, also, I compared with other LPWA technologies such as Sigfox, LoRa.

**C. Group exercise based on BLE tech**

In this group work, I learnt the physical layer transmission techniques used in BLE and the applied mathematics behind the theory concepts such as, 
- nyquist formula for calculating bandwidth
- relation between the connection state and sleep state in determining the throughput
- PDU and MTU size which are determined based on the connection interval
- Adaptive frequency hopping technique for reducing the interferences
- Friis formula to calculate the free space path loss and thus the range

**D. Individual work on GNURadio**

In this work, the focus is on applying the theory concepts & the math.  
- Application of Shannon’s theory for determining the sampling period
- Reception of the frequency modulation based transmitted signals (FM Radio)
