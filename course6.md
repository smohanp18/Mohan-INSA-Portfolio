## Course Overview & Learning - Pr. Sami

### Course 6 : Cloud
### Module A : Cloud and Autonomic Computing

#### Descriptive Part :

In a short course on Cloud computing and virtualization, I did 2 TP exercises with the following objectives for learning and skill development.
1. Recognize the fundamental differences between the types of hypervisors’ architectures
2. Recognize the fundamental differences between the two main types of virtualisation hosts , i.e. virtual machines (VM) and containers (CT)
3. Operate VirtualBox VMs provisioning, in NAT mode, and make appropriate configurations so that VMs can access and be accessed through the Internet
4. Operate Docker containers provisioning, and make appropriate configurations so that containers can access and be accessed through the Internet
5. Operate proper VMs provisioning with OpenStack and manage the networking connectivity
6. Familiarize several phases that make up cloud end-user applications provisioning process
7. Implement part of the provisioning process using sample JEE application on Cloud Foundry and Jelastic


#### Technical Part :
- Virtualbox deployment for ‘hosted’ hypervisor architecture
-- Created/deleted/managed VMs using Virtualbox
- Openstack deployment for ‘baremetal’ hypervisor architecture
-- Created/deleted/manipulated VMs using Openstack
- Container deployment using Linux IXC and Docker
- Cloud end-user application provisioning in a PaaS such as Jelastic, Cloud Foundry


#### Skills analysis : 

- Creation/deletion and management of Virtual machines in bare metal virtualization architectures
- Creation/deletion and management of Virtual machines in hosted cloud virtualization architectures
- Differentiating when to choose VM deployment vs Container deployments
- Differentiating the layers – IaaS, PaaS, Cloud End-user applications
- Provisioning end-user applications using PaaS technologies


#### Self-assessment :
